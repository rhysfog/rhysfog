### CODING:
* **1985-1992**: At the age of eleven, I finally saved up $100 from bottle recycling to pay for my half of a [Tandy TRS-80 16k computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80) - my parents paid for the rest. It used a TV as a monitor and audio cassette for data storage. I taught myself to code in BASIC and made games, text-based at first, then later, slowly, painfully and with little success, with graphics.

* **1992**: Coding in Ada for a university course.

* **2000-2001**: Certificate IV in Programming Technology - C++.

* **2010-2020**: Coding in R to analyse large-scale genetic and clinical data. I created an application to search the human genome for the genes nearest to any genomic location; and others to plot data for publication in [science journals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4177327/pdf/nihms-619477.pdf "Common variants near ABCA1, AFAP1 and GMDS confer risk of primary open-angle glaucoma").

* **2010-2018**: Self-taught Python to create simple side-scrolling games.

* **2020-current**: Self-taught HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
