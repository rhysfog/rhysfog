            <h2>WHAT IS ORIENTEERING?</h2>
            <p>Orienteering is a navigation sport in which participants use a map to complete a course in the quickest time possible. Courses consist of several controls which participants must visit in the correct order with progress recorded by an electronic timing system.</p>
            <p>Courses may be in suburban or bush locations and distances vary depending on the format (generally 2-4km for shorter events, up to 12km for the longest events). Events for younger children include string courses and Kid-O.</p>
